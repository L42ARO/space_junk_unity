# SPACE JUNK

Very simple Unity VR game :)

## How to run

There are 3 ways to get this to run

### Without a developer account
I mean get a developer account is not that hard. But if not:
Straight up download the whole reop, download Unity 2022.3.41f1. And play it in the Unity editor with Quest Link enabled on your Oculus Quest. An overcomplicated solution to a simple question

### With a developer account
Feel free to download the apk of the latest build located [here](https://github.com/L42ARO/space_junk_unity/releases)
Then proceed to either use the _Meta Quest Developer Hub_ and upload the app that way **or** use some sideloader technique to get it to play on your Quest headset. I'll leave it up to you
